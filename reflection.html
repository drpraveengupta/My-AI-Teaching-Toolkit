<h2>A personal reflection on how AI tools have transformed the teaching-learning experience.</h2>
<h2>üìù Reflective Note</h2>
<p class="reflection-text">
  Artificial Intelligence has significantly transformed my approach for teaching and learning. As an engineering college teacher, after attending this workshop, now I am using many AI tools to generate lecture content, summarize complex topics, and create engaging visual aids in much less time. This allows me to focus more on interacting with students and improving their understanding. Many AI-powered platforms helped me to design quizzes, flashcards, and assignments that are custom-made to each topic. For my own learning, AI gives me quick access to research works, new teaching strategies, and updated technological trends. Overall, AI acts like a supportive assistant, making my teaching process simpler, more personalized, and efficient. It not only saves time but also brings creativity and innovation into teaching. AI has truly made education smarter and more accessible for both teachers and learners.
